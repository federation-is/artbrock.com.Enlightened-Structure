Welcome. My web site is a catch-all for the strange projects and activities that I’m involved in. Friends who know I’m not good about sending correspondence or newsletters have encouraged me to provide a central place to keep up. 

The truth is that since my first web site in 1995, I really haven’t been reliable for posting much about myself. Now I’m being poked, prodded and supported in doing so. So I hope to do better.

I spend most of my time and energy on projects that I believe support and accelerate the harmonious evolution of humanity. We live in strange and miraculous times. Rapid transition and transformation surround us, but the outcomes of these transitions are still uncertain. I believe that humanity has much greater capacities than we currently employ. I am working to unleash those capacities for the mutual benefit of all.

You can find out more [about me](#about) on the bottom of this page or learn about [projects](-projects) old and new. I’m also trying to include regular media from my activities on the “[go deepe](http://www.artbrock.com/deeper)r” page.

![Arthur Brock](http://www.artbrock.com/sites/artbrock.com/files/Arthur_Brock_caricature.png)Arthur Brock builds targeted currencies that are at the core of the emerging post-industrial economy. He has created more than 100 designs for multi-currency systems and his software company has built and deployed dozens of those systems.

Initially, Arthur put his degree in Artificial Intelligence to use at GM, Chrysler & Hughes, but he soon realized he was committed to bringing intelligence to social architectures rather than to computers. He started student-run schools and award-winning, employee-run businesses and discovered that the self-managing feedback loops needed to operate these types of organizations were built on particular patterns of incentives and measurement. He began to unlock the social DNA by which groups operate and uncover the critical role of currencies as carriers of that social DNA.

Arthur’s designs include currency systems for: collaborative scientific research, sustainable fishery management, corporate compensation plans, employee stock options, community-based economic development, business barter and exchange, triple-bottom-line trade credits, open source software development, customer loyalty programs, water rights, recirculating gift certificates, community service, employee performance management, arts & culture development, efficient resource sharing & management, and community & environmental impact assessment.
